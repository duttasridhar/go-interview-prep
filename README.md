# Golang Interview Preparation

Thanks for interviewing at Averlon.
To make sure that we can use our time best in the interviews,
we'd like to have you do some setup on your laptop in advance.

First, _clone_ or _download_ this repository to your computer
via the links on the right
(creating a fork of the repository is not necessary).

# Getting Ready

If you can run these commands, your development environment is probably
ready for Golang interview questions:

```bash
$ go version
$ git clone [the project\'s URL]
$ cd [into the project]
$ go test ./...
```
